# sudoku
###A console based sudoku game developed using C++.


This is a console based application.

It was primarily written to run on Windows console. So, it makes use of several functions which are specific to Windows OS.

Other operating systems may have similar functions which achieve the same functionality.
Feel free to make use of them if you intend to run this on other operating systems.


I wrote this application in my early years of programming.
I ended up with close to 1000 lines of code in a single file.
This taught me why splitting code into multiple files is a good practice.

So, if you got no better things in the world to do, you can try splitting this large piece of code into several files.
If you manage to do so, please send me a pull request and I'd be very glad to accept it.
